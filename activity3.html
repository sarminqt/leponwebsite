	<h1>No Time To Pray</h1>
	<h3>By K. J. Koshy</h3>
	<p class="poem">
		I knelt to pray but not for long, <br>
		I had to hurry and get to work<br>
		For bills would soon be due.<br><br>

		So I knelt and said a hurried prayer, <br>
		And jumped up off my knees.<br>
		My Christian duty was now done<br>
		My soul could rest at ease. <br><br>

		All day long I had no time<br>
		To spread a word of cheer.<br>
		No time to speak of Christ to friends,<br>
		They'd laugh at me I'd fear.<br><br>

		No time, no time, too much to do,<br>
		That was my constant cry,<br>
		No time to give to souls in need<br>
		But at last the time, the time to die.<br><br>

		I went before the Lord,<br>
		I came, I stood with downcast eyes.<br>
		For in his hands God held a book;<br>
		It was the book of life.<br><br>

		God looked into his book and said<br>
		"Your name I cannot find.<br>
		I once was going to write it down...<br>
		But never found the time"<br>
